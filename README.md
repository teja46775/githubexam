# GitHub Copilot Experience Report

## Overview

This README documents my experience using GitHub Copilot to assist in generating code solutions for this repository. It covers the code generated by Copilot, any modifications made to the scripts, the testing process, and provides instructions on running the script.

## Experience Using Copilot

### Code Generation

GitHub Copilot was used to generate scripts and code snippets based on natural language prompts. Copilot provided function templates, logic implementations, and even some documentation comments, making the coding process faster and helping to overcome writer's block.

### Modifications

Some scripts generated by Copilot required modifications to better fit the requirements or to fix issues:
- **Logic Adjustments:** Occasionally, the generated code didn’t exactly match the desired output or logic, so I adjusted function bodies, variable names, or the flow to align with the problem statement.
- **Error Handling:** I added error handling in cases where Copilot omitted it.
- **Formatting:** Ensured code followed best practices and repository style guides.

### Testing the Script

After modifying the scripts, I tested them by:
1. Running the script with sample inputs and checking the outputs against expected results.
2. Using print/debug statements to verify intermediate values.
3. Iterating on the code with Copilot suggestions when encountering errors or unexpected outputs.

## How to Run the Script

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/teja46775/githubexam.git
    cd githubexam
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   (If applicable — e.g., for Python)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Script:**  
   Replace `script_name.py` with the actual script filename you want to run.
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
    Or, for shell scripts:
    ```bash
    bash script_name.sh
    ```

4. **Testing:**  
   Follow in-script instructions or provide input as required. Review output for correctness.

## Notes

- Each script may have its own requirements or usage; see the script's header comments for additional details.
- If you encounter any issues, please check that you are using the correct Python version or required runtime.

## Conclusion

Copilot streamlined the coding process, provided useful code suggestions, and helped in quickly prototyping solutions. Manual review and testing were important to ensure the quality and correctness of the scripts generated.
